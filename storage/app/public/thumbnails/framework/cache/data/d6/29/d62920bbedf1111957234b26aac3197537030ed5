    <p>
        Take your eyes off of me so I can leave I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me This is never ending, we have been here before But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore Please, stay where you are Don't come any closer Don't try to change my mind I'm being cruel to be kind I can't love you in the dark It feels like we're oceans apart There is so much space between us Baby, we're already defeated Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah Everything changed me You have given me something that I can't live without You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine The longer we ignore it, all the more that we will fight Please, don't fall apart I can't face your breaking heart I'm trying to be brave Stop asking me to stay I can't love you in the dark It feels like we're oceans apart There is so much space between us Baby, we're already defeated Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah Everything changed me We're not the only ones, I don't regret a thing Every word I've said, you know I'll always mean It is the world to me that you are in my life But I want to live and not just survive That's why I can't love you in the dark It feels like we're oceans apart There is so much space between us Baby, we're already defeated 'Cause, ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah Everything changed me And I-I-I-I-I don't think you can save me
